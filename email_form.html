Pretend there is a working PHP script here that uses mail() to send your email automatically......

I don't think I can do that though without an actual web server, so this functionality is on hold.

(after a little googling, I think that's how I can do it)

If you do need to contact me though, please e-mail yifan.ma@uwaterloo.ca. If you go back on your browser, your form should not have been cleared so you can copy-paste the message.
